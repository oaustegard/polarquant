"""remex: Retrieval-validated embedding compression.

Compress embeddings 2-16x with proven recall. Based on the rotation + Lloyd-Max
scalar quantization insight from TurboQuant (Zandieh et al., ICLR 2026,
arXiv:2504.19874). Implements the MSE-optimal stage which empirically
outperforms the full TurboQuant Prod variant for nearest-neighbor retrieval.

Supports Matryoshka bit precision: encode once at full bit-width, then
search at any lower precision via right-shifting indices. Enables two-stage
coarse-to-fine retrieval from a single encoded representation.

Formerly known as polar-embed.
